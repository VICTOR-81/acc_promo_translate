                    To become an individual entrepreneur, you do not need authorized capital and it is not necessary to hire employees. Both residents and non-residents of Georgia can become an IE. Registration may be completed remotely by proxy.

                    <h2>Also, preferential taxation applies to this legal form.</h2>
                    <p>There are 3 preferential statuses: individual entrepreneur with a small status, fixed payer and micro business</p>
                    <p>An ordinary individual entrepreneur pays 20% of income taxes annually. There are no restrictions on annual turnover.</p>
                    <p>
                    An individual entrepreneur with a low status pays 1% of revenue, that is, from gross profit before deducting expenses. The annual turnover of a small entrepreneur should not exceed 500,000 lari. With an aggregate excess of 1 million lari over two years, this status is officially canceled. Small business status is assigned by the tax office.
                    There is also the simplest form of doing business – microbusiness. In this case, the turnover should be no more than 30,000 lari per year and there should be no employees. In this case, your business will be completely exempt from income tax, but you will need to pay office rental tax, if any, in the amount of 5%. Most often, the status of micro-business in Georgia is enjoyed by family businesses, private hotels, hostels, guest houses, artisans, taxi drivers, tourist guides, etc.

                    <p>A Georgian resident company, which is subject to income tax (in accordance with Part 1 of Article 97 of the Tax Code of Georgia), can calculate to receive the status of an international company. Also, the company must conduct permitted activities (the list of permitted activities is specified in

                    In addition, international companies in Georgia will be partially exempt from property tax and will be able to reduce the corporate income tax base.
